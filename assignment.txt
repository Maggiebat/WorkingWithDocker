1. Explain the importance of Docker in modern software development. (10 points) 
- Docker is important as a software dev tool and for virtualization technology. It's easy to develop, deploy, and manage apps using Docker containers.
The containers also provide security. Docker provides a lot of ease in the software development world.
2. Explain how Docker containers are different from virtual machines. (10 points) 
- Docker containers can run multiple applications in a
single OS kernal while a virtual machine are needed when the
application or service is required to run on a different OS.
3. Discuss any challenges or difficulties you encountered during the assignment and how you overcame them. (10 points)
- The challenge of using docker was setting up docker. There were a lot of different pieces to build up to using docker that it became overwhelming at times
There was also the fact that there was a lot of behind the scene issues such as my computer having an outdated version of python. Luckily for me, I
participated in Data Fest over the weekend previous where I was forced to update my python (solving problem 1 of why nothing was installing) and it also
taught me to use a virtual enviorment which made the process much quicker for me the second time.
